Tasks Completed May 08, 2014	

1. Database Designs

Created table schema in MySQL Workbench.  There are two tables, a user table for log in and a bookmarks table that will house all information on bookmarks that users upload.
Foreign key has been placed on userID column in bookmarks that relates to userID for log in so that users are able to only see their own bookmarks.
Added "browser" column so that users can upload exports from different browsers.

2. Dataflow Models
- User uploading export file
Dataflow model that goes through process of a user filling out information, title of file, description (optional), which browser it is from, and selecting the file from their computer to upload.
Users have the option to add a description to remind themselves with a general overview of what might be found based on what browser they have uploaded from.

- User selecting bookmarks based on browser
Dataflow model demonstrates a user who is on the bookmarks page that shows all different browsers they have uploaded bookmarks from.  The user may select by browser and is brought to page that contains all the bookmarks that were in the file they had uploaded.
